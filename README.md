# Cyber Breach Search Engine

## Overview
The **Cyber Breach Search Engine** is a prototype tool that allows users to search for data breaches in which their personal information may have been compromised. Built using **Streamlit** and **Python**, this app enables individuals to input keywords such as their name, email, or type of breach to see if their data has been involved in any known data breaches.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Search**: Users can search by keywords like name, email, or breach type.
- **Sorting by Date**: View recent breaches first for timely information.
- **Data Visualization**: View breach details in a structured, easy-to-read table.
- **Cybersecurity Recommendations**: Personalized security tips based on detected data types within search results.
- **Security Tips Sidebar**: Stay informed with simple, actionable security tips.

## Using : 
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Streamlit**


**Run the application**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Project Files
- `app.py`: Main application file.
- `breach_data.csv`: Mock dataset simulating real-world data breaches.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.


## Example Usage
1. Start the app using the command above.
2. Enter a search term in the sidebar, such as your email or breach type.
3. View breach results in the main panel and get personalized security tips.

## Future Enhancements
- **Real Data Integration**: Connect to actual data sources or APIs for live breach updates.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Add multi-criteria filtering for more refined search results.
- **User Alerts**: Notify users of newly detected breaches involving their data.
